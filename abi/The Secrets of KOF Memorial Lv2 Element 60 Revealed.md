If you want to defeat Element 60 in KOF Memorial Lv2, you will need to have a good strategy and a lot of skill. Here are some tips that might help you:
 
- Choose your team wisely. You can select up to three characters to form your team, and you can switch between them during the fight. You should pick characters that have good mobility, range, and damage output. Some examples are Kyo, Iori, K', Terry, Ryo, Athena, Mai, and Leona.
- Use your special moves and supers. Each character has a set of special moves and supers that can be activated by pressing certain button combinations. These moves can deal more damage than normal attacks, and some of them have special effects, such as stunning, burning, or freezing the enemy. You should use these moves whenever you have enough energy in your gauge.
- Dodge and block Element 60's attacks. Element 60 has a lot of different attacks that can hit you from different angles and distances. You should try to avoid them by moving around the screen, jumping, or rolling. You can also block his attacks by holding back on the directional pad or joystick. However, blocking will reduce your guard gauge, which can leave you vulnerable if it runs out.
- Attack Element 60 when he is vulnerable. Element 60 is not invincible, and he has some moments when he is open to attack. For example, when he teleports, he leaves behind a trail of sparks that indicates where he will reappear. You can use this to anticipate his position and hit him before he can react. Another example is when he creates clones of himself. You can tell which one is the real one by looking at his health bar or his energy gauge. You should focus on attacking the real one and ignore the clones.
- Use your team members to assist you. You can call your team members to help you by pressing the assist button. They will perform a special move that can hit Element 60 or distract him for a few seconds. You can also switch to another team member by pressing the tag button. This will allow you to recover some health for your previous character while using a fresh one.

Element 60 is a tough opponent, but not impossible to beat. With enough practice and patience, you can overcome him and finish the game. Good luck!
