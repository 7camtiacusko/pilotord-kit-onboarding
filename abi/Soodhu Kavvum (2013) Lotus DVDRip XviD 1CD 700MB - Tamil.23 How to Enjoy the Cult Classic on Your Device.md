The plot of Soodhu Kavvum follows Das (Vijay Sethupathi), a middle-aged man who leads a gang of four misfits: Kesavan (Ashok Selvan), Sekar (Ramesh Thilak), Pagalavan (Bobby Simha) and Ravi (Karunakaran). They specialize in kidnapping people for ransom, but they only target those who are corrupt and immoral. They also follow a set of rules, such as not harming the hostages, not asking for more than â¹2 lakh and not involving the police.
  
One day, they kidnap a young boy named Arumai Pragasam (Sanchita Shetty), who is the son of a wealthy politician named Bramma (M. S. Bhaskar). However, they soon realize that Arumai is actually a con artist who staged his own kidnapping to extort money from his father. Arumai joins forces with the gang and convinces them to ask for a higher ransom of â¹2 crore.
  
Meanwhile, Bramma's son and heir-apparent JK (V. S. Raghavan) is unhappy with his father's decision to pay the ransom. He hires a psychotic encounter specialist named Bramma (Yog Japee) to track down the kidnappers and kill them. Bramma also has a personal grudge against Das, who had humiliated him in the past.
  
The rest of the film shows how Das and his gang try to escape from Bramma's wrath and how their lives get intertwined with Arumai's fate. The film also explores the themes of morality, greed, friendship and love in a darkly humorous way.
