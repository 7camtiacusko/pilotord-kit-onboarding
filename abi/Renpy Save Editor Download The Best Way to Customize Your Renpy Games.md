## How to Use Renpy Save Editor?
 
Using Renpy Save Editor is very easy. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Find your save file. Depending on the platform you are playing on, your save file might be located in different folders. For example, on Windows, it might be in `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\RenPy\GameName`. On Android, it might be in `/sdcard/Android/data/org.renpy.android/files/saves`. On iOS, it might be in `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/GameName/Documents/saves`. You can also use a file manager app to locate your save file.
2. Upload your save file to Renpy Save Editor. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/r/RenPy/comments/10r1cjp/save\_editor\_for\_all\_renpy\_versions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RenPy/comments/10r1cjp/save_editor_for_all_renpy_versions/) and click on the link to the tool. Then, click on the "Choose File" button and select your save file from your device. The tool will load your save file and display its data.
3. Edit your save file. You can browse through the data by clicking on the tabs and expanding the nodes. You can edit any value by double-clicking on it and typing a new value. You can also use expressions to calculate values or assign variables. For example, you can type `$ money = money + 1000` to add 1000 to your money variable. You can also use Python functions and operators to manipulate values. For example, you can type `$ name = name.upper()` to make your name all uppercase.
4. Save your changes. When you are done editing your save file, click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the tool. A new file called "edited.save" will be downloaded to your device. You can rename it to whatever you want, as long as it has the same extension as your original save file (usually ".rpy").
5. Replace your original save file with the edited one. Copy or move your edited save file to the same folder where your original save file was located. Make sure to overwrite or delete your original save file, or rename it to something else if you want to keep a backup.
6. Load your edited save file in the game. Start your game and load your edited save file from the menu. You should see the changes you made reflected in the game.

Congratulations! You have successfully edited your Renpy save file with Renpy Save Editor.
