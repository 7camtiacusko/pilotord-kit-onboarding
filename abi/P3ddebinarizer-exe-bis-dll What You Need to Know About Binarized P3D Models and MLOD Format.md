P3DDebinarizer.exe is a tool that allows you to convert p3d files from ODOL format to MLOD format. ODOL format is a binary format used by ArmA, ArmA 2 and ArmA 2 OA for their models, while MLOD format is a text format that can be edited with tools like Oxygen 2. MLOD format is useful for modding, editing or creating custom models for the games.
 
To use P3DDebinarizer.exe, you need to have Bis.dll in the same folder as the tool. Bis.dll is a library file that contains some functions used by the tool. You can download Bis.dll from [T\_D tools homepage](https://dev-heaven.net/projects/mikero-pbodll/files) in Dev-Heaven.

There are two ways to use P3DDebinarizer.exe: with parameters or without parameters. If you use parameters, you need to specify the source file and the destination file in the command line. For example:
 `P3DDebinarizer.exe C:\Arma2\addons\ca\buildings\house.p3d C:\Arma2\addons\ca\buildings\house_mlod.p3d` 
This will convert the house.p3d file from ODOL format to MLOD format and save it as house\_mlod.p3d in the same folder.
 
If you don't use parameters, a dialog will appear where you can select a p3d file to convert. The tool will automatically generate a destination file name by adding \_mlod to the source file name. For example, if you select house.p3d, the tool will create house\_mlod.p3d.
 
After the conversion is done, you can open the MLOD file with Oxygen 2 or other tools and edit it as you wish. Be aware that some features of ODOL format may not be preserved in MLOD format, such as animations, proxies or textures.

In this section, we will show you how to open and edit a MLOD file with Oxygen 2. Oxygen 2 is a tool that allows you to create and modify models for ArmA games. You can download Oxygen 2 from [BIStudio Wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Oxygen_2_-_Personal_Edition).
 
To open a MLOD file with Oxygen 2, you need to launch the tool and select File -> Open. Then browse to the folder where you saved the MLOD file and select it. The file will be loaded in the main window of Oxygen 2.
 
To edit a MLOD file with Oxygen 2, you can use the tools and menus available in the interface. You can move, rotate, scale, add or delete objects, assign textures, create animations, set proxies and more. For a detailed tutorial on how to use Oxygen 2, visit [BIStudio Wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Oxygen_2_-_Manual).
 
When you are done editing the MLOD file, you need to save it and export it to ODOL format. To save the MLOD file, select File -> Save or Save As. To export the MLOD file to ODOL format, select File -> Export -> ODOL P3D. You will be asked to choose a destination folder and a file name for the ODOL file. The ODOL file will be created in the selected folder.
 
Now you have a custom model that you can use in ArmA games. To use the model in the game, you need to create a config file and a PBO file. For more information on how to do that, visit [BIStudio Wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA:_Addon_Configuration).
