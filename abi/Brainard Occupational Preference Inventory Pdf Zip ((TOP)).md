The BOPI consists of 120 items that describe various activities related to six broad occupational fields: commercial, mechanical, professional, esthetic, scientific, and agricultural (for boys) or personal service (for girls). The respondents are asked to rate their interest in each activity on a five-point scale ranging from "very much dislike" to "very much like". The BOPI takes about 30 minutes to complete and requires a low level of reading skill.
 
The BOPI yields scores for each of the six occupational fields, which can be compared with percentile norms by sex based on a restandardization sample of students in grades 8-12. The BOPI also provides information on the reliability and validity of the scores, as well as the intercorrelations among the fields. The BOPI can help individuals identify their areas of strength and interest, as well as explore potential career paths that match their preferences.
